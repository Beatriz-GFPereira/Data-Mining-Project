### Workflow
This work was developed during the 1st semester divided in 2 main topics: Data preprocessing and Clustering (using SOM and K-means).
ATTENTION: Please download the original data from https://github.com/joaopfonseca/DMDSAA/blob/master/data/gw_data.zip to a folder "data" where you would have this project stored.
The preprocessed data will be downloaded to that folder after you run the Data_Exploration&Preprocess.ipynb file.
